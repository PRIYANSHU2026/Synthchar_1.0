- `_redirects` - Netlify redirect rules

### Deployment Scripts
- `deploy.sh` - Main deployment script that builds and packages the application
- `verify-deployment.sh` - Script to verify the deployment structure
- `test-deployment.sh` - Script to test the deployment configuration
- `prepare-netlify.sh` - Original Netlify preparation script

### Documentation
- `README.md` - General deployment instructions
- `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` - Detailed deployment guide
