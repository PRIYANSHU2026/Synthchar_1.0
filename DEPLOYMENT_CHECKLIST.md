# SynthChar Deployment Checklist

## Deployment Structure

The deployment structure has been created at `~/Desktop/SynthChar-Deployment/` with the following organization:

- [x] Source code (`src/` directory with app, components, contexts, lib, types)
- [x] Public assets (`public/` directory with images)
- [x] Configuration files (next.config.js, netlify.toml, _redirects)
- [x] Environment variables (.env.production)
- [x] Package files (package.json, package-lock.json)
- [x] Deployment scripts (deploy.sh, verify-deployment.sh, test-deployment.sh)
- [x] Documentation (README.md, DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md, DEPLOYMENT_SUMMARY.md)

## Pre-Deployment Checks

- [ ] Run `./verify-deployment.sh` to verify the deployment structure
- [ ] Run `./test-deployment.sh` to test the deployment configuration
- [ ] Check that all required environment variables are set in `.env.production`
- [ ] Ensure `next.config.js` is configured for static export
- [ ] Verify that `netlify.toml` has the correct build settings

## Deployment Steps

- [ ] Navigate to the deployment directory: `cd ~/Desktop/SynthChar-Deployment`
- [ ] Run the deployment script: `./deploy.sh`
- [ ] Upload the generated `netlify-deploy.zip` to Netlify
- [ ] Configure the site in the Netlify dashboard
- [ ] Verify the deployed site is working correctly

## Post-Deployment Checks

- [ ] Check that all pages are loading correctly
- [ ] Verify that all assets (images, CSS, JS) are loading
- [ ] Test the site's functionality
- [ ] Check that the site is responsive on different devices
- [ ] Verify that the site is secure (HTTPS)

## Notes

- The deployment structure is optimized for Netlify hosting
- The configuration is set up for static site generation
- Environment variables are configured for production
- The deployment scripts automate the build and packaging process
